#### What is this app?
Have you ever needed help from your friends and family on various chores or tasks around the city/world? Well, this application solves that problem! The Collaborative Checklist App allows users to form private groups with their families and friends, and create an interactive digital checklist within their groups for all group members to assist with. Each item you add will have a location to find or complete it, and if anybody else in your group is nearby, they'll be notified of the task!
